Project Overview
Urban Loom is designed as a marketplace builder with a focus on seamless user experience, performance optimization, and reliable backend integration. The project architecture leverages modern React patterns and state management using Zustand, ensuring that components remain modular and easily testable.

Key Aspects
Component Testing:
Every component—such as Cart, Header, Add to Cart, QuantityOfItems, etc.—has its own dedicated test file. These tests cover UI rendering, interaction logic (like adding items, updating quantities, and error handling), and snapshot comparisons to track unintended changes.

Error Handling & Logging:
The code implements proper error handling techniques using try-catch blocks and fallback UI strategies, ensuring that the application remains robust even when unexpected issues occur.

Backend Integration:
The project includes refinements in backend integration, ensuring that API calls are reliable, performant, and secure.

Authentication:
Using Clerk, Urban Loom provides secure authentication flows. Components adjust based on the user's authentication state, offering a smooth transition between signed-in and guest user experiences.

Future Enhancements
Further performance optimizations.
Additional UI/UX improvements based on user feedback.
Expansion of backend functionalities for a more robust marketplace experience.
